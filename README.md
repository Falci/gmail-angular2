# Gmail with Angular2

This project is based on [Mark Brown](https://github.com/markbrown4/)'s [gmail-angular](https://github.com/markbrown4/gmail-angular) project and uses [One Hungry Mind](https://github.com/onehungrymind)'s [fem-ng2-simple-app](https://github.com/onehungrymind/fem-ng2-simple-app) as an initial bootstrap.

## Dependencies
- You must have `node v >= 4.0` and `npm` installed
- `npm i -g typings webpack-dev-server webpack rimraf`
- If you have previously installed `typings`, be sure you are on `version 1.x` as this repo requires it

## Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/Falci/gmail-angular2.git
cd gmail-angular2
npm i
typings install
npm start
```

Then navigate your browser to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) and use the app.
